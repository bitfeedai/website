      "q": "How does it work?",
      "a": "Bitfeed consists of two major parts, bits and feeds. Bit's can be created using Bitfeed's wizard. Feeds are essentially boards on which bits can be placed. Checkout our documentation page to learn more about how to get started or checkout our examples.",

      "q": "Is this app free to use?",
      "a": "For creating and reading feeds, Bitfeed is and will remain free. However, for the creation of bits the Bitfeed Wizard is used, which uses external AI-services that requires an API key and come with associated costs. The user can pay these costs directly to the relevant provider when using their own API key. The same applies to the use of Bitfeed without personal API keys, but in this case, the costs will be recalculated by us and may vary depending on our provider’s current pricing and usage limits.",
