# Bitfeed Website

The public landing page for Bitfeed - a graph of widgets where boards naturally function as dashboards, automations, APIs, interactive experiences, or feeds.

## About Bitfeed

Bitfeed is a graph of widgets. Build widgets, connect them into boards, and the board's projection emerges naturally from its composition. Widgets come in different forms: frontend-only components, widgets with predefined backend function nodes, or full containerized micro-applications. Boards are structural containers where widgets are placed and connected—the board's projection type (dashboard, automation, API, interactive experience, or feed) emerges from its widget composition.

### Key Features

Bitfeed enables you to create:
- Widgets (from simple frontend components to containerized applications)
- Boards (structural containers where widgets are connected)
- Emergent projections (dashboards, automations, APIs, interactive experiences, feeds)
- Universal data connectivity
- AI-powered no-code widget creation
- Marketplace ecosystem

### How It Works

Bitfeed consists of two major parts:
- **Widgets**: The atomic unit—frontend-only components, widgets with predefined backend function nodes, or containerized micro-applications created using Bitfeed's AI Wizard
- **Boards**: Structural containers where widgets are placed and connected. The board's projection type emerges naturally from its widget composition

### Open Source & Community

Bitfeed is committed to open-source software development and believes in the democratization of information. The platform thrives on community collaboration, where creators, developers, and AI enthusiasts come together to build and share their widgets and boards.
