## About Bitfeed

Bitfeed is a platform for creating personalized feeds powered by AI, built from small, flexible widgets called **Bits**. These Bits can be combined to craft entire custom dashboards and informative feeds, giving you full control over how you organize and display information.

### Key Features

Bitfeed enables you to create:
- RSS Feeds
- Dynamic Maps
- Custom Forms
- Digital Flyers
- Targeted Ads
- External Tools
- Social Media Accounts
- Track Information
- Filter Content
- Interactive Charts
- 3D Animations

### How It Works

Bitfeed consists of two major parts:
- **Bits**: Small, versatile widgets created using Bitfeed's wizard (which uses external AI services)
- **Feeds**: Boards on which Bits can be placed to create custom dashboards

### Open Source & Community

Bitfeed is committed to open-source software development and believes in the democratization of information. The platform thrives on community collaboration, where creators, developers, and AI enthusiasts come together to build and share their Bits and Feeds.
